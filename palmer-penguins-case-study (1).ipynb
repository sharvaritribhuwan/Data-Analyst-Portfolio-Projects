Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.\n\nDataset was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) team. It contains 344 observations of penguin species, including Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, along with 7 variables such as species, island, culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, body mass and sex.\n\n## Objective\n1. Is there any relationship between bill length, body mass and penguin species?\n2. Looking for trends in species and sex of penguins.\n3. Record of species percentage in islands.\n\n## Process\n1. I have used SQL for organising and cleaning the data. [Link for SQL](http://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=554595511095:7df80afeefe9423bbcfa58ecb4344809)\n2. Used Amazon Quicksight for Data Visualization.

[Link for Scatterplot](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sharvari.tribhuwan/viz/Palmer_penguins_dashboard/Dashboard1): The scatter plot displays the relationship between body mass and flipper length of different species of penguins. The plot reveals a positive correlation between body mass and flipper length, which is but obvious as larger the bodymass, bigger the flipper length will be. Scatterplot also shows that Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have a similar distribution, while Gentoo penguins have a relatively larger body mass and longer flipper length.\n\n2.

Both male and female of species have same density of population. \n\n3.
